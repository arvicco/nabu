# Coptic Scriptorium fixtures (P17-1 Phase B)

Real files from `github.com/CopticScriptorium/corpora` at release tag
**v6.2.0** (commit `6c2acf0ebebf62f40c3834259cf6fd734238e371`, "Late 2025
Release", 2025-12-12 — the pinned sync tag). Retrieved **2026-07-13** via
`raw.githubusercontent.com/CopticScriptorium/corpora/v6.2.0/<path>`.
Owner-approved fixture plan (survey §9, approved 2026-07-13), including the
optional 4th documentary sample. Layout mirrors the upstream corpus tree so
the adapter's discover walks fixtures exactly as it walks canonical.

## Files and the quirks each preserves

- `besa-letters/besa.letters_TT/on_lack_of_food.tt` (whole, 22 KB)
  — the MODERN TT dialect (v4.5.0: `<translation>` elements inside the
  verse, `vid_n` per-verse CTS urns, expanded `orig_group`/`orig` spans).
  Gold everything; full MS metadata block (MONB.BB codex, Naples,
  `origDate` 0500–0799 precision `medium` → the document_axes assertion,
  Trismegistos 108395); entity spans; morphs — including **the
  morph-split-across-line-break quirk** (ϣⲡ|ϩⲓⲥⲉ: `lb_n` 1 closes and 2
  opens INSIDE one norm token, between its two morphs); Greek `<lang>`
  spans; supralinear strokes (U+FE24–26, combining overlines) live in
  `orig` vs stripped in `norm`; the `⳿` morphological divider (U+2CFF, the
  conventions §9 `cop` fold subject); CC-BY 4.0 license string with HTML
  entities (`&lt;a href=…&gt;`) → per-document `attribution` override.
- `besa-letters/besa.letters_CONLLU/on_lack_of_food.conllu` (whole, 9.7 KB)
  — the CoNLL-U twin, NOT parsed in v1; checked in for the deferred
  UD-FEATS join (survey §4b/v2-3). Discover must never yield it.
- `sahidica.nt/sahidica.nt_TT.zip` — rebuilt zip with two members
  (in-repo-zip discover path; the four big bible corpora ship TT only as
  zips, and their loose CoNLL-U files are 2-byte placeholders upstream):
  - `41_Mark_01.tt` TRIMMED to the meta line + verses 1–12 (upstream lines
    1–2495 byte-identical, `</meta>` re-added; 263,156 B → 72,878 B).
    The OLDER TT dialect (v4.1.0), gold: `<translation>` element OPENS
    BEFORE `<verse_n>` (span overlap — the format is a span stack, not a
    tree); duplicate `segmentation` attribute in the meta line; dense
    `<lang>` loanword spans (37 in the trim); the J. Warren Wells
    "academic use only" license string → the `nc` posture, NO override;
    `people`/`places` rosters; `document_cts_urn` carries the `:1`
    chapter suffix + `chapter="1"` → the chapter→book merge.
  - `57_Philemon_01.tt` (whole, 110,626 B) — the single-chapter-book merge
    edge case (one member still mints the book document, urn without the
    chapter suffix), AND the third, COLLAPSED structural dialect the
    survey's 8 samples did not surface: no `orig_group`/`orig`/`lang`
    spans — `orig_group` rides as an attribute on `norm_group`, `orig` and
    `lang` as attributes on `norm`; `translation` as an attribute on
    `verse_n`. Automatic annotation quality (lemma rows NOT minted by
    default).
- `AP/apophthegmata.patrum_TT/AP.004.poemen.65.tt` (whole, 19.6 KB)
  — `identity="Poemen"` Wikification on gold entities; `Greek_source`
  (Nau-collection citation, metadata only); `Arabic_translation` credit
  AND embedded per-verse `<arabic>` spans (upstream's release notes say
  Arabic ships only in ANNIS — this file disproves that for AP, carried
  as the `translation_ar` annotation); `<note>` damage span; `hi_rend`
  (red ekthetic); multiple `<translation>` units inside one verse (v3).
- `doc-papyri/doc.papyri_TT/cpr.2.237.tt` (whole, 21 KB) — the
  `copticDoc` urn namespace (`papyri_info.tm82127.cpr_2_237`);
  `source="http://papyri.info/ddbdp/cpr;2;237"` alt-edition
  cross-reference (never dedupe, conventions §3); NO `verse_n` at all →
  the translation-unit ordinal fallback (addressing flagged
  non-canonical); documentary span dialect `pb` recto/verso + `p` (vs
  literary `pb_xml_id`/`p_n`) and `source_lang` (vs `lang`);
  `figure`/`figDesc` seal spans that CLOSE out of order (`</figDesc>`
  before `</figure>` — the not-a-tree proof); `origDate` 0700–0799.

## The dual-origin pair (P17-10)

`ot.hab.bohairic_ed` is the ONE work urn upstream mints from two origins
(everywhere else standalone editions carry distinct `_ed` urns —
`nt.mark.sahidica_ed` loose vs `nt.mark.sahidica` zip). Both fixtures were
trimmed 2026-07-13 from the LOCAL canonical tree at the pinned v6.2.0 tag
(`canonical/coptic-scriptorium/…`, byte-identical to the raw-URL tag paths
below), verse ranges chosen so the pair exercises the precedence rule and
the historical unzip-exit-9 crash shape:

- `bohairic-habakkuk/bohairic.habakkuk_TT/bohairic.Habakkuk_01.tt` —
  TRIMMED to the meta line + `lb_n` 1–2 + verses 1–2 (upstream lines 1–325
  byte-identical, `</meta>` re-added; 118,874 B → 10,183 B). The standalone
  digital edition: v6.2.0 (2025-11-25), segmentation/tagging/parsing/
  entities/identities all GOLD, `people`/`places` rosters, `lb_n`
  manuscript topology, public-domain text + CC-BY 4.0 annotations →
  `attribution` override. Source: `bohairic-habakkuk/bohairic.habakkuk_TT/
  bohairic.Habakkuk_01.tt` in the canonical tree.
- `bohairic.ot/bohairic.ot_TT.zip` — rebuilt zip (`zip -X`) with 1 of 637
  members: `35_Habacuc_01.tt` cut to the meta line + verses 1–2 (upstream
  member lines 1–316 byte-identical, `</meta>` re-added; 116,894 B →
  9,430 B). The SAME work urn from the bible zip: frozen v6.0.0
  (2024-10-31) automatic snapshot, minimal header, CC-BY-SA. Source:
  `bohairic.ot/bohairic.ot_TT.zip!35_Habacuc_01.tt` in the canonical tree.

The two origins are byte-DIFFERENT (the P17-10 census: revised lemmas,
re-tokenization, the added `lb_n` layer) — the same edition at two
releases, so the standalone corpus wins by precedence and the zip member
is skipped by rule (counted in the discovery accounting).

## License chain

Per-document `license` field in each TT meta header (the parser's source
of record — never hardcoded, the ORACC precedent): Besa/AP/cpr are
CC-BY 4.0 (verbatim, HTML-entity-encoded anchor to
creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0) → `license_override: attribution`;
the sahidica.nt members carry "(c)2000-2006 by J Warren Wells, for
academic use only" (link to copticscriptorium.org/download/corpora/Mark/
coptic_nt_sahidic.html) → the source's own `nc` class, no override.
Source class `nc` = most-restrictive-present (P10-4, inverted proportion:
~87% of upstream docs are CC-BY(-SA) and get the attribution override).
