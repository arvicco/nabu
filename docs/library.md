# The Library — content review

**As of 2026-07-08** (post Phase 9 + P9-4c recovery, branch phase-9). Live totals:
**65,307 documents / 2,821,439 passages** across 8 sources, 16 language codes,
873 aligned English translation editions, 1,599,485 lemma rows in 7 languages.

This is a living document. Numbers are read from the live catalog
(`sqlite3 -readonly db/catalog.sqlite3`), not estimated. See §9 for the
review cadence that keeps it truthful.

## 1. Classical Greek literature

| | |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Canonical literary texts: epic, drama, historiography, philosophy, oratory, medicine |
| **Language** | Ancient Greek (`grc`), polytonic; aligned English (`eng`) |
| **Period** | Archaic through Imperial — Homer (8th c. BCE) to roughly 3rd c. CE |
| **Size** | 768 Greek docs + 650 English editions = 1,418 docs / 394,706 passages |
| **Source** | `perseus-greek` (Perseus Digital Library canonical-greekLit), license: `attribution` (CC BY-SA) |
| **Metadata** | CTS URNs (`urn:cts:greekLit:tlg…`), work/edition hierarchy, canonical citation schemes (book.line, Stephanus pages, etc.), TEI EpiDoc structure preserved as passage paths |

The backbone of the Greek canon: Homer, Hesiod, the tragedians, Aristophanes,
Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, the orators, Plutarch, Galen and more.
650 of the 768 Greek editions carry an aligned English translation displayable
side-by-side (`--parallel`, span-grouped with coverage labels).

**Research uses:** close reading with facing translation; citation-precise
quotation (ranges like `:1.1-1.32` resolve natively); philological search with
Greek-aware folding (final sigma, diacritics); intertext hunting across the
canon; source-checking quotations found in later literature.

## 2. Post-classical Greek (First Thousand Years)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Later Greek prose: technical, scientific, theological, historiographical, paradoxographical |
| **Language** | Ancient Greek (`grc`); aligned English (`eng`) |
| **Period** | Mostly Hellenistic through Late Antique — 3rd c. BCE to ~6th c. CE |
| **Size** | 1,088 Greek docs + 41 English editions = 1,129 docs / 256,480 passages |
| **Source** | `first1k-greek` (Open Greek & Latin First1KGreek), license: `attribution` |
| **Metadata** | CTS URNs, same EpiDoc parser family as Perseus, section-level citations |

The long tail Perseus doesn't cover: Athenaeus, Philo, church fathers,
grammarians, scholia, minor historians, medical and mathematical writers.
Complements §1 with the texts scholars actually struggle to find in searchable
form. English coverage is thin (41 editions) but includes section-aligned
pieces like Palaephatus' De Incredibilibus.

**Research uses:** reception history (how classical authors were quoted and
reworked); patristics; history of science and medicine; lexicography of
post-classical Greek; locating fragments and testimonia preserved only in
later compilers.

## 3. Classical Latin literature

| | |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Canonical Latin literature: epic, lyric, drama, historiography, oratory, philosophy, letters |
| **Language** | Latin (`lat`); aligned English (`eng`) |
| **Period** | Republican through Imperial — Plautus (3rd–2nd c. BCE) to Late Antiquity |
| **Size** | 353 Latin docs + 181 English editions = 534 docs / 391,799 passages |
| **Source** | `perseus-latin` (Perseus canonical-latinLit), license: `attribution` |
| **Metadata** | CTS URNs (`urn:cts:latinLit:phi…`), canonical citations (book.chapter.section, poem.line), includes legacy P4-TEI editions recovered via the P9-2 ladder (notably Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, in both Latin and English) |

Vergil, Ovid, Horace, Cicero, Caesar, Livy, Tacitus, Seneca and the rest of
the PHI-derived canon. Latin folding (v→u, j→i) is applied at the search
layer, so `iuvenis`/`juvenis`/`iuuenis` all resolve.

**Research uses:** same modes as §1 for the Latin side; prose rhythm and
formula studies via concordance; Livy + Caesar + Tacitus as a continuous
historiographical corpus; checking Latin quotations and mottos to their exact
locus.

## 4. Documentary papyri

| | |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Documentary texts: contracts, tax receipts, petitions, private letters, census returns, leases, court records |
| **Language** | Greek (`grc`, 57,901 docs), Coptic (`cop`, 2,047), Latin (`lat`, 1,425), Arabic (`ar`, 12), Demotic (`egy-Egyd`, 2) |
| **Period** | Ptolemaic to early Islamic Egypt — c. 300 BCE to 8th c. CE |
| **Size** | 61,389 docs / 921,248 passages (94% of all documents in the library) |
| **Source** | `papyri-ddbdp` (Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri via papyri.info), license: `attribution` |
| **Metadata** | DDbDP identifiers (series.volume.number), Leiden-convention editorial markup preserved (restorations, cancellations — including the cancelled-⟦⟧ fallback class), fragment/side structure as passage paths |

The everyday written record of a millennium of Egypt: what people bought,
owed, sued over, and wrote home about. This is *documentary*, not literary —
the language is non-standard, formulaic in places, full of phonetic spellings,
and therefore a unique witness to living Greek (and the Coptic and Arabic
transitions).

**Research uses:** social and economic history (prices, wages, taxes, land
tenure); onomastics and prosopography; vernacular/koine linguistics (real
misspellings = real phonology); legal history; formula studies across
centuries (concordance shines here); everyday-life color for any narrative
about Greco-Roman Egypt.

## 5. Sanskrit corpus

| | |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Full breadth of Sanskrit literature: Vedic saṃhitās, epics, purāṇas, kāvya, drama, śāstra (philosophy, law, grammar, poetics), tantra, Buddhist and Jain texts, technical treatises |
| **Language** | Sanskrit in IAST romanization (`san-Latn`, 770 docs), plus stray Tibetan-transliteration, Tamil and English items |
| **Period** | Vedic (c. 1200 BCE) to early modern (18th c. CE) — the longest span of any shelf |
| **Size** | 773 docs / 696,158 passages (second-largest shelf by passages) |
| **Source** | `gretil` (GRETIL, Göttingen Register of Electronic Texts in Indian Languages, via TEI mirror), license: `nc` (CC BY-NC-SA — local research use; **excluded from MCP by default**) |
| **Metadata** | Four addressability rungs (attribute-cited divisions, `// Abbr_N //` in-text verse markers, xml:id citations, prose ordinals); collision-disambiguated URNs (`:b2`) preserve upstream numbering errors instead of hiding them; Vedic accents preserved (keep-`<orig>`) |

Rāmāyaṇa (18,761 verses), Mahābhārata-adjacent texts, Bhāgavata and other
purāṇas, Kālidāsa and the kāvya tradition, Brahmasūtra with commentaries and
sub-commentaries, dharmaśāstra, Nāṭyaśāstra, Dhvanyāloka with its commentary
layers (kārikā vs. vṛtti separately citable as `:DhvK.…`/`:DhvA.…`),
Buddhacarita, Gītagovinda. After P9-4c only 8 of 781 upstream files remain
unparsed (4 genuinely unaddressable, 4 awaiting a micro-packet).

**Research uses:** Indology across every genre; commentary-tradition studies
(base text and commentaries interleaved but separately citable); Vedic accent
studies; comparative epic (alongside Homer in §1); history of Indian
philosophy through the sūtra + bhāṣya chains; searchable pada-level access to
texts that mostly exist as scanned books elsewhere.

## 6. Morphosyntactic treebanks

| | |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Gold-standard linguistically annotated corpora: lemma, morphology, dependency syntax per token |
| **Language** | Latin (`lat`), Greek (`grc`), Gothic (`got`), Classical Armenian (`xcl`), Old Church Slavonic (`chu`), Old East Slavic (`orv`), Vedic Sanskrit (`san`) |
| **Period** | 5th c. BCE (Herodotus) through 17th c. CE (Avvakum) |
| **Size** | 64 docs / 161,048 passages across three sources: `proiel` (12 docs / 51,321), `torot` (40 / 33,085), `ud` (12 / 76,642) |
| **Sources** | PROIEL (frozen release), TOROT (Tromsø OCS/OES), Universal Dependencies (gothic-proiel, greek-proiel, latin-ittb, sanskrit-vedic); all license: `nc` |
| **Metadata** | **This is where the lemma layer comes from**: 1,599,485 rows in `passage_lemmas` (lat 583k, grc 379k, orv 207k, san 190k, chu 123k, got 99k, xcl 18k), searchable via `search lemma:` with per-language folding and suppletive-form support (affero → attulimus) |

Three families: PROIEL's parallel New Testament (Greek original + Latin
Vulgate + Gothic Wulfila + Classical Armenian + OCS Codex Marianus — five
versions of the same text, morphologically annotated) plus classical prose
(Herodotus, Caesar, Cicero); TOROT's Old East Slavic and OCS shelf (birchbark
letters, chronicles including the Kiev Chronicle, Domostroj, Avvakum,
Afanasij Nikitin); UD treebanks adding Thomas Aquinas (ITTB, the largest
Latin lemma pool) and Vedic Sanskrit.

**Research uses:** any lemma-based query (find every inflected occurrence of
a word regardless of form); historical/comparative linguistics across the
five-way parallel NT — the single best alignment laboratory in the library;
Slavic diachrony from OCS to Middle Russian; morphology-driven stylistics;
training/evaluation data if the local inference cluster takes on tagging
(improvements §3.1 plans to project lemmas onto the other 90% of the corpus).

## 7. Aligned English translations (cross-cutting layer)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Category** | Not a source — an alignment capability spanning §§1–3 |
| **Size** | 873 English editions / ~238,000 passages |
| **Coverage** | perseus-greek 650, perseus-latin 181, first1k-greek 41 (+1 GRETIL stray) |

The highest-numbered English edition per work is auto-selected; `show
--parallel` renders original and translation span-grouped, with coverage
labels when the translation's citation grain is coarser than the original
(`eng [:1.1 — covers :1.1–:1.32]`).

**Research uses:** makes the Greek/Latin shelves readable to non-specialists;
translation-studies comparisons; quick orientation before committing to a
close reading; teaching materials.

---

## 8. Library-wide capabilities

- **Full-text search** with per-language folding (Greek final-sigma and
  diacritics, Latin u/v i/j, generic diacritic folding for IAST Sanskrit) —
  `bin/nabu search`, FTS5 under the hood.
- **Lemma search** (`search lemma:…`) over the treebank shelf (§6);
  ranking-independent `urn:` filtering.
- **Citation-native retrieval**: `show <urn>` with range support
  (`:1.1-1.32`), suffix display by default, `--full-urn` for scripts.
- **Concordance** (`concord`): KWIC lines with fold-aware matching that maps
  hits back to pristine (accented) text.
- **Parallel display** (`show --parallel`): §7.
- **MCP server** (4 read-only tools: `nabu_search`, `nabu_show`,
  `nabu_status`, `nabu_concord`): exposes the library to Claude and other MCP
  clients. Every passage carries `license_class` + `source`;
  `nc`/`research_private`/`restricted` content is **excluded by default** —
  currently that means GRETIL and the treebanks are local-CLI-only.
- **Protection stack**: upstream deletions are attic'd, never propagated
  (`retired_upstream` documents stay searchable); content-hash ledger
  (`db/history.sqlite3`) survives rebuilds; rsync backup to mounted volume +
  restore drill (`rake ops:drill`) proves the collection is reconstructable.
- **Health**: trend rules (spike/collapse/creep/stale), golden-query replay
  (13 goldens), remote drift + license-baseline probes.
- **Licensing split**: `attribution` shelf (Perseus ×2, First1K, papyri —
  ~99% of documents) is shareable/MCP-safe; `nc` shelf (GRETIL, treebanks) is
  local research use.

## 9. Review plan

This document goes stale the moment a sync or a phase lands. Standing plan:

1. **Every phase gate** (before the PR): refresh the header totals and any
   table a packet touched; new source = new section. This is part of the
   gate's README-truthfulness pass — the orchestrator owns it.
2. **After every owner-fired real sync**: re-read `bin/nabu status` and the
   per-source counts; update sizes if drift >1%. Cheap — one query per table.
3. **Quarterly full review** (next due **2026-10-08**): re-verify every
   number from the live db, re-examine the "research uses" claims against
   what actually got used (MCP query logs are a signal once they exist),
   prune sections describing capabilities that changed, cross-check against
   docs/improvements.md so the two documents don't diverge on what's planned
   vs. shipped.
4. **Trigger-based**: a license-baseline probe alarm (health §) or a
   quarantine-count change on any source obliges an immediate spot-update of
   the affected section.

Numbers are always read from the live catalog read-only; this file never
becomes the source of truth — it's the map, the catalog is the territory.
