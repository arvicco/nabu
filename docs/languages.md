# Languages of the library

**As of 2026-07-22** (post the Japanese reading desk and the P40 Germanic
wave — 28,046,116 live passages across the 88-row registry; live
inventory: every code below appears in the catalog, the lemma index, or
the reference shelf). This page explains the code system once, then lists
the significant codes with one sentence each (the corpus now carries 108
passage languages; the long tail of single-inscription script variants is
folded into grouped rows).

**The headline has moved east.** With Kanripo and CBETA loaded, **`lzh`
(Literary Chinese) is the library's largest language by a wide
margin — 13.2M passages**, nearly the whole rest of the corpus put
together; Sumerian (`sux`, 3.03M) is second, Japanese (`jpn`, 2.99M — the
Aozora desk) third, and Ancient Greek (`grc`, 2.01M) leads the West.

**The desk reference is a command (P18-4), and languages are now
file-backed (P19-1):** `nabu language CODE` explains any code this page
covers AND the **803-code** Wiktionary etymology universe the `etym`
cognate lists surface (`gkm`, `zle-ort`, `zlw-opl`…) — name, family,
curated context, and live holdings, in ~0.2 s. **The curation's home is
the `canonical/local-language/` dossier shelf (architecture §16)** — one
Markdown file per code, edit it in any editor, then `nabu sync
local-language` re-derives the card. The owner-fired migration is
complete: the dossiers on disk derive the catalog's `language_records`
(name, family, context, and the IE-CoR witness sections — that shelf's
first programmatic writer), and the `config/languages.yml` seed is
retired. The derived names census (`language_names`, from the held kaikki
extracts) is **filled** — 160 name records, feeding the inline
`[gkm · Medieval Greek]`-style rendering in `etym --long`.
`nabu ingest --shelf language CODE` scaffolds a new dossier;
`nabu language --list` prints the held languages.

## The system, in five rules

1. **Codes are BCP-47-shaped**: a primary language subtag (ISO 639: `grc`,
   `lat`, `chu`…), optionally followed by a **script subtag** (`san-Latn` =
   Sanskrit in Latin transliteration) or another qualifier. Validation is
   shape-only, so a few deliberate non-ISO codes pass (rule 4).
2. **The code names the language of the passage text as stored** — not the
   manuscript's, not the modern nation's. GRETIL stores IAST romanization,
   so its Sanskrit is `san-Latn`; the UD Vedic treebank stores Devanagari-
   independent CoNLL-U, so it is plain `san`. CCMH stores the corpus's own
   7-bit transliteration but the *language* is still `chu`.
3. **Historical stages ride the nearest standard code, documented**: Old
   East Slavic, Middle Russian, and Ruthenian all live under `orv`
   (following Universal Dependencies); Early Modern Slovenian and the
   ~1000 CE Freising Manuscripts under `sl` (no better subtag exists —
   an acknowledged anachronism).
4. **Reconstruction shelves use Wiktionary's etymology codes verbatim**
   (`sla-pro`, `ine-pro`, `gem-pro`) — non-ISO, kept because they join
   directly against the upstream descendants data (conventions §4).
5. **Search folding is per-language** (conventions §9): the code picks the
   rule — `grc` final-sigma, `lat` u/v–i/j, `ang` æ→ae/þ,ð→th,
   `sl`/`gmh` ſ→s (Slovenian and the ReM Middle High German diplomatic
   text), `akk`/`sux` determinative stripping, generic diacritic folding
   elsewhere. Where a source's language differs from a tool's expectation,
   the per-document override records reality (P10-4).

## Corpus languages (documents / passages)

| Code | Language | One sentence |
|---|---|---|
| `lzh` | Literary Chinese | The library's largest language by passages (13.0M) — the Kanripo classical-Chinese repository and the CBETA Buddhist canon (Taishō + Xuzangjing), plus the HDIC Heian-period character-dictionary line. Since P37-2, traditional/simplified/z-variant spellings fold to one search skeleton (conventions §9). |
| `grc` | Ancient Greek | The largest *Western* language and second overall (1.99M passages) — Homer through the papyri to Swete's Septuagint, both Greek NTs, and the EDH bilinguals, polytonic. |
| `sux` | Sumerian | The language isolate of the earliest written literature, from Ur III royal inscriptions to the great lexical lists — 3.03M passages, the largest cuneiform language. |
| `akk` | Akkadian | East Semitic language of Babylon and Assyria, held in transliteration with ORACC's gold lemmas (SAA letters, omens, royal inscriptions) — now joined at scale by the CDLI and eBL fragment shelves. |
| `san-Latn` | Sanskrit (IAST romanization) | The GRETIL, SARIT, and DCS shelves — Vedas to early-modern śāstra — stored in the international transliteration scheme with accents preserved (0.84M passages). |
| `san` | Sanskrit (Devanagari / CoNLL-U) | The UD Vedic treebank and the gold-lemmatized Digital Corpus of Sanskrit; `san-Deva` holds the Devanagari-scripted SARIT slice separately. |
| `pli` | Pali | The SuttaCentral Tipiṭaka — the segmented Pali canon (0.44M passages), aligned to its English and the Chinese Āgamas. |
| `sl` | Slovenian (historical) | Early Modern print (Dalmatin 1584 → 1899), the IMP historical-Slovene corpus, and, by lineage, the ~1000 CE Freising Manuscripts (0.41M passages). |
| `hit` | Hittite | The Anatolian cuneiform corpus at fragment scale — the TLHdig transliterations beside the lexical-list entries, gold- and silver-lemmatized (0.36M passages). |
| `syc` | Classical Syriac | The Digital Syriac Corpus (632 TEI documents) and the ETCBC Peshitta OT — extending the Aramaic axis by a millennium (0.17M passages). |
| `egy` | Egyptian | The Ancient Egyptian Sentences (AES/TLA) and Late-Egyptian/Demotic Hugging-Face shelves — 0.12M gold-lemmatized passages from the Pyramid Texts onward; `egy-Egyd` holds a couple of Demotic papyri separately. |
| `lat` | Latin | Republican and Imperial classics, Jerome's Vulgate, the Clementine bible, papyrus fragments — and, since the EDH sync, ~81,000 inscriptions (library.md §8g); 0.80M passages. |
| `cop` | Coptic | The last stage of Egyptian: documentary papyri plus the literary Coptic Scriptorium shelf in Sahidic and Bohairic, gold-lemmatized (233,020 rows; library.md §8f). |
| `qpc` | Proto-cuneiform | The pre-linguistic administrative tablets of the late 4th millennium BCE (dcclt archaic lists) — signs before language. |
| `hbo` | Biblical Hebrew | The Masoretic shelves — OSHB Westminster Leningrad, the BHSA/ETCBC treebank, the Dead Sea Scrolls — gold-lemmatized, NFC-exempt (0.09M passages). |
| `xeb` | Eblaite | The eBL/Ebla East-Semitic lexical material from the cuneiform fragment shelves (0.05M passages). |
| `arc` | Aramaic / Targumic | The Sefaria Targum shelf, DSS Aramaic, and cuneiform-shelf traces — now 0.05M passages, gold-lemmatized where the Targums carry it. |
| `chu` | Old Church Slavonic | The OCS canon: Codex Marianus, Suprasliensis, and the four CCMH gospel manuscripts (incl. Assemanianus and Savvina kniga). |
| `orv` | Old East Slavic (incl. Middle Russian, Ruthenian) | Birchbark letters, chronicles, Avvakum, and the prosta mova chancery texts, 1025–1700. |

| `got` | Gothic | Wulfila's Bible — the oldest substantial Germanic text, gold-lemmatized in PROIEL. |
| `gmh` | Middle High German | The ReM reference corpus (1050–1350), synced live 2026-07-22: 406 manually annotated texts / 355,449 manuscript lines, diplomatic layer stored (long ſ folds to s — rule 5) — and instantly the corpus's **third-largest gold-lemma pool** (2.10M rows). |
| `non` / `gmq-pro` | Old Norse / Proto-Norse | The North Germanic lane (synced live 2026-07-22): Menotec's seven Old Norwegian treebanks and the Poetic Edda of Codex Regius (gold PROIEL-scheme morphology), plus Rundata's runic corpus in transliteration with its Old-West-Norse normalisation lane — 39,923 passages; the urnordisk-dated inscriptions carry `gmq-pro` (the wiktionary-recon proto-code convention of rule 4 — no ISO code exists; 822 passages). |
| `osx` | Old Saxon | The *Heliand* (HeliPaD, synced live 2026-07-22): 3,549 syntactically parsed tree blocks with gold form-lemma pairs — the 9th-century gospel harmony beside its Gothic and Old English gospel cousins. |
| `is` | Icelandic (diachronic) | IcePaHC via UD — the 12th–21st c. under the one modern tag (the `orv`/Middle-Russian precedent of rule 3); **configured, arrives at the next `sync ud`** (no passages yet). |

| `ett` / `osc` / `xlu` / `xtg` / `xfa` / `xve` / `scx` / `xly` / `xpu` / `xrr` | Etruscan / Oscan / Luwian / …the pre-Roman epigraphic long tail | The Italic, Anatolian, and Mediterranean inscription corpora (OpenEtruscan, CEIPoM, ItAnt, LexLep, TIR, I.Sicily) — dozens of languages, mostly script-tagged (`-Grek`/`-Latn`/`-Ital`), many at a few hundred passages each. |
| `eng` / `en` / `ger` / `deu` / `ita` / `pol` / `fra` | Modern translation tags | The facing-translation layer (Perseus/First1K, WEB/Vulgate, SuttaCentral, Freising) — never originals; `en`/`deu` are legacy strays standardizing on `eng`/`ger`. |
| `und` | Undetermined | Inscriptions (chiefly EDH and epigraphic-shelf) whose language the upstream record could not determine — coded honestly rather than guessed. |

*(All seven proto shelves are live — `define`/`etym` walk them with
multi-hop closure and per-edge "(loan)" flags — the Phase-18 trio
(`iecor`, `liv`, `edl`) synced live 2026-07-14, and the Phase-30–33
expansion added the StarLing bases, the Hebrew/Egyptian/Slovenian
desks, and the Sino/Japanese shelves. The table above is representative:
**56 dictionary shelves** now hold **1,310,763 entries** total
(2026-07-22 census) —
library.md §8c/§8h/§8j/§8k/§8m/§8o/§8q/§8s/§8t enumerate them per phase.)*

## Gold-lemma languages (searchable via `--lemma`, 26 as of today)

`san, sux, gmh, egy, lat, grc, orv, akk, hbo, non, cop, sl, chu, ojp,
sga, got, osx, bul, ang, xcl, peo, arc, hit, xhu, elx, uga` — the
treebanks, ORACC, goo300k, DCS, ONCOJ, the Hebrew/Egyptian shelves,
Coptic Scriptorium, and the P40 Germanic shelves feed these
**15,000,556 gold rows** (ordered above by pool size: `san` 5.54M and
`sux` 2.97M lead; **`gmh` debuts third at 2.10M** — the ReM sync of
2026-07-22 — with `non` 258K and `osx` 47K landing in the same wave as
gold languages #24–26). A parallel **silver layer** adds 8,244,309
machine-suggested rows in 8 languages (chiefly Greek/Diorisis 7.54M and
Hittite/TLHdig), always labelled. Everything else is full-text-searchable
but not lemma-searchable (yet — see improvements §3.1 for the cluster
plan to project lemmas onto the rest). One staged lane remains: `is`
(IcePaHC's first Icelandic lemma lane) is configured and arrives at the
next `sync ud`.
